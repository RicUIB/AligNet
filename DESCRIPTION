Description: This package implements AligNet, a novel alignment algorithm aimed
    to obtain a global pairwise alignment of protein interaction networks, but
    also, to analyze the networks from the topological study of their
    modularization. AligNet obtains biological meaningful modules of a PPI
    network considering an overlapping clustering based on a similarity score
    between pairs of proteins, which is defined considering both their
    topological and their biological information. The analysis of the networks
    consists of the study of some topological features of the modules. Then,
    AligNet is able to obtained a well defined global pairwise alignment from
    the local alignment of the modules, which improved the results of the
    previous algorithms in the tests that we performed. The novelty of our tool
    AligNet is that on one hand, it is a tool for the global pairwise alignment
    of protein interaction networks and, on the other hand, it is also a tool
    for the analysis of a protein interaction network. The main advantage of
    AligNet, is that the analysis of the networks to be aligned is performed
    before the alignment itself. This entails that before computing the
    alignment we know wether the networks are well studied or, on the contrary,
    we can infer that they are not. Since the goodness of the alignment is
    related to the goodness of the networks, knowing in advance the networks
    accuracy is important to understand the final alignment.
